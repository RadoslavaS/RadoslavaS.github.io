Hi, this is **Radka**! Aiming to bring statistical models to healthcare. With **just finished PhD** in Computer Science, I am **now looking for new opportunities in Zürich and surroundings:** either as a postdoc in the field of causal inference, sequential decision making or broader applied statistics, or as an applied researcher in industry. 

I worked as a **Doctoral researcher** at the [BSP group](https://bsp-meditech.ch/), part of the [MeDiTech institute](https://www.supsi.ch/en/meditech) at SUPSI in Lugano, Switzerland. Before I was a **Researcher and Data Scientist** at the [SCCH](https://www.scch.at/) in Austria, after graduating from master of **Statistics and Data Science** at [Johannes Kepler University](https://www.jku.at/institut-fuer-angewandte-statistik/) in Linz, Austria. 
Originally I come from Liptovský Mikuláš, Slovakia.

My current research focus is on applications of **sequential decision making and inference** for behavioral change systems and lifestyle quantification, utilising longitudinal wearable data combined with contextual information. During my PhD I developed a system for personalised nudging in e-health mobile application CUOREMA by utilising **bandits from reinforcement learning**. For the evaluation of its effectivness and better lifestyle quantification I exploited principles from **causal inference** and **causal discovery**. I am also interested in adaptive clinical trials and real world evidence from observational data.

In my free time I like to *travel* and discover new countries and *cultures*, do *mountain sports* such as hiking, skiing and skitouring or just relax during a walk in the city or with a good book. 

If you are **interested in the longitudinal dataset with wearables that will be soon made publicly available**, drop me an email and I will add you to the waiting list.

In the section [blog](../blog) I am documenting my learning notes and anything I find interesting.

If you are **interested in doing a master thesis** in the field of *applied statistics* or *applied machine learning* or *applied causal inference* or *causal discovery* for deriving personalised insights from (longitudinal) data collected by **wearables** (and **mHealth** solutions), feel free to get in touch!

If you own a **Garmin** device or live in Lugano and would be willing to borrow one from BSP for free, and would like to participate in a **data collection** for my internal research study **Wearables and well-being**, please contact me.
