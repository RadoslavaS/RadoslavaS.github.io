Hi, this is **Radka**! Aiming to bring statistical models to healthcare. **Now looking for postdoc opportunities starting in the end of 2025 / beginning of 2026 in the field of sequential decision making, causal inference or broader applied statistics, in Switzerland**. 

Currently a **PhD student** at the [University of Bern](https://neuro.inf.unibe.ch/) and at the [Biomedical Signal Processing (BSP) group](https://bsp-meditech.ch/), part of the [MeDiTech institute](https://www.supsi.ch/en/meditech) at the University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland (SUPSI) in Lugano, Switzerland. 
Previously I was a **Researcher and Data Scientist** at the [Software Competence Center Hagenberg](https://www.scch.at/) in Austria, after graduating from master of **Statistics and Data Science** at [Johannes Kepler University](https://www.jku.at/institut-fuer-angewandte-statistik/) in Linz, Austria. 
Originally I come from Liptovský Mikuláš, Slovakia.

My current research focus is on applications of **sequential decision making and inference** for behavioral change systems and lifestyle quantification, utilising longitudinal wearable data combined with contextual information. During my PhD journey I developed a system for personalised nudging in e-health mobile apps by utilising **bandits from reinforcement learning**. For the evaluation of its effectivness and better lifestyle quantification I am exploiting principles from **causal inference** and **causal discovery**. I am also interested in adaptive clinical trials and real world evidence from observational data, including target trial emulation.

In my free time I like to *travel* and discover new countries and *cultures*, do *mountain sports* such as hiking, skiing and skitouring or just relax during a walk in the city or with a good book.

In the section [blog](../blog) I am documenting my learning notes and anything I find interesting.

In [curriculum vitae](../cv) you can find something more about my journey.

If you are **interested in doing a master thesis** in the field of *applied statistics* or *applied machine learning* or *applied causal inference* or *causal discovery* for deriving personalised insights from (longitudinal) data collected by **wearables** (and **mHealth** solutions), feel free to get in touch!

If you own a **Garmin** device or live in Lugano and would be willing to borrow one from BSP for free, and would like to participate in a **data collection** for my internal research study **Wearables and well-being**, please contact me.
